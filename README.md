for record the process of learning algorithm ans data structures
the best way of learning is learning by doing, so i am going to implement all popular algorithms and data structures, and most of my code is from [swift-algorithm-club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club) i just have them python

# Basic
* [Stack](./Queues/Stack.py)
* [Queue](./Queues/Queue.py)
* [Insertion Sort](./sorting/Insertion_Sort.py)
* [Binary Search](./search/Binary_Search.py)
* [Binary Search Tree](./tree/Binary_Search_Tree.py)

# The Algorithms

## Sorting 

### Basic sorts:
* [Insertion Sort](./sorting/Insertion_Sort.py)
* [Selection Sort](./sorting/Selection_Sort.py)
* [Shell Sort](./sorting/Shell_Sort.py)

### Fast sorts:
* [Quick Sort](./sorting/Quick_Sort.py)
* [Merge Sort](./sorting/Merge_Sort.py)
* [Heap Sort](./sorting/Heap_Sort.py)

# Data structures

## Variations on Arrays
* [Array2D](./array/Array_2D.py). A two-dimensional array with fixed dimensions. Useful for board games.
* Bit Set. A fixed-size sequence of n bits.
* [Fixed-Size Array](./array/Fixed_Size_Array.py). When you know beforehand how large your data will be, it might be more efficient to use an old-fashioned array with a fixed size.
* [Ordered Array](./array/Ordered_Array.py). An array that is always sorted.
* [Rootish Array Stack](./array/Rootish_Array_Stack.py)

## Queues
 
* [Stack](./Queues/Stack.py). Last-in, first-out!
* [Queue](./Queues/Queue.py). First-in, first-out!
* [Deque](./Queues/Deque.py). A double-ended queue.
* [Priority Queue](./Queues/Priority_Queue.py). A queue where the most important element is always at the front.
* [Ring Buffer](./Queues/Ring_buffer.py). Also known as a circular buffer. An array of a certain size that conceptually wraps around back to the beginning.

## List 
* [Linked List](./list/Link_List.py). A sequence of data items connected through links. Covers both singly and doubly linked lists.
* [Skip List](./list/Skip_List.py). Skip List is a probabilistic data-structure with same logarithmic time bound and efficiency as AVL/ or Red-Black tree and provides a clever compromise to efficiently support search and update operations.


## Tree
* [Binary Tree (BST)](./tree/Binary_Search_Tree.py).  A binary tree that orders its nodes in a way that allows for fast queries.
* [Heap](./tree/Heap.py). A binary tree stored in an array, so it doesn't use pointers. Makes a great priority queue.
Fibonacci Heap.
