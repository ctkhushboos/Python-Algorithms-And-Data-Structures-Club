for record the process of learning algorithm ans data structures
the best way of learning is learning by doing, so i am going to implement all popular algorithms and data structures, and most of my code is from [swift-algorithm-club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club) i just have them python

# Basic

* [Stack](./queue/stack.py)
* [Queue](./queue/queue.py)
* [Insertion Sort](./sorting/insertion_sort.py)
* [Binary Search](./search/binary_search.py)
* [Binary Search Tree](./tree/binary_search_tree.py)

# The Algorithms

## Sorting

### Basic sorts:

* [Insertion Sort](./sorting/insertion_sort.py)
* [Selection Sort](./sorting/selection_sort.py)
* [Shell Sort](./sorting/shell_sort.py)

### Fast sorts:
* [Quick Sort](./sorting/quick_sort.py)
* [Merge Sort](./sorting/merge_sort.py)
* [Heap Sort](./sorting/heap_sort.py)

# Data structures

## Variations on Arrays

* [Array2D](./array/array_2D.py). A two-dimensional array with fixed dimensions. Useful for board games.
* Bit Set. A fixed-size sequence of n bits.
* [Fixed-Size Array](./array/fixed_size_array.py). When you know beforehand how large your data will be, it might be more efficient to use an old-fashioned array with a fixed size.
* [Ordered Array](./array/ordered_array.py). An array that is always sorted.
* [Rootish Array Stack](./array/rootish_array_stack.py)

## Queues

* [Stack](./queue/stack.py). Last-in, first-out!
* [Queue](./queue/queue.py). First-in, first-out!
* [Deque](./queue/deque.py). A double-ended queue.
* [Priority queue](./queue/priority_queue.py). A queue where the most important element is always at the front.
* [Ring Buffer](./queue/Ring_buffer.py). Also known as a circular buffer. An array of a certain size that conceptually wraps around back to the beginning.

## List

* [Linked List](./list/link_list.py). A sequence of data items connected through links. Covers both singly and doubly linked lists.
* [Skip List](./list/skip_list.py). Skip List is a probabilistic data-structure with same logarithmic time bound and efficiency as AVL/ or Red-Black tree and provides a clever compromise to efficiently support search and update operations.


## Tree

* [Tree](./tree/tree.py). A general-purpose tree structure.
* [Binary Tree (BST)](./tree/binary_search_tree.py).  A binary tree that orders its nodes in a way that allows for fast queries.
* [Heap](./tree/heap.py). A binary tree stored in an array, so it doesn't use pointers. Makes a great priority queue.
Fibonacci Heap.
