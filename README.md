for record the process of learning algorithm ans data structures
the best way of learning is learning by doing, so i am going to implement all popular algorithms and data structures, and most of my code is from [swift-algorithm-club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club) i just have them python

# Basic
* [Stack](./Queues/Stack.py)
* [Queue](./Queues/Queue.py)
* [Insertion Sort](./sorting/Insertion_Sort.py)
* [Binary Search](./search/Binary_Search.py)
* [Binary Search Tree](./tree/Binary_Search_Tree.py)

# Data structures

## Queues
 
* [Stack](./Queues/Stack.py). Last-in, first-out!
* [Queue](./Queues/Queue.py). First-in, first-out!
* [Deque](./Queues/Deque.py). A double-ended queue.
* [Priority Queue](./Queues/Priority_Queue.py). A queue where the most important element is always at the front.

## Tree
* [Binary Tree (BST)](./Tree/Binary_Search_Tree.py).  A binary tree that orders its nodes in a way that allows for fast queries.
* [Heap](./Tree/Heap.py). A binary tree stored in an array, so it doesn't use pointers. Makes a great priority queue.
Fibonacci Heap
